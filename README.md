This project looks at an email and converts the letters into numbers using the Vectorizer based on a trained model. This model has been trained with 60 examples and understands key words in order to understand the intent behind the email being read; this will increase productivity and allow requests to go into the correct direction without it being time consuming. It utilizes FastAPI as well as LanGraph to handle classifying a email and showcasing the result, the intent. 

I had a sample meeting regarding insurance expiring soon and to renew as soon as possible. After the meeting, I downloaded the transcript and sent it to the bot to identify exactly which intent is being spoken here. It gave me the result of "PolicyRenewal" as the final intent based on the transcript.
